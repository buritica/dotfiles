# Repository Conventions and Rules

For complete documentation, please refer to:
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed contribution guidelines
- [README.md](README.md) for project overview and release process

## Critical Conventions

### Version Control
- Branch names must use prefixes: `feature/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `chore/`
- Direct commits to master are not allowed
- All changes require pull requests

### Pull Requests
- Must have version label:
  - `version/major` for breaking changes
  - `version/patch` for backward-compatible bug fixes
  - No label defaults to minor version bump
- Titles must follow conventional commits format (`fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:`, `chore:`)

### File Standards
- GitHub Actions: use `.yml` extension (not `.yaml`)
- Templates: use `.tmpl` extension
- All names should be lowercase with hyphens for spaces

### Workflow Jobs
- Must use lowercase names (e.g., `ci`, `security`)
- Security runs weekly + on PRs
- CI runs on PRs + master push
- Release runs on master merge only

### Documentation
- README badges must be lowercase and verified
- Keep CONTRIBUTING.md as source of truth for processes
- Update docs when changing automated processes

## Branch Naming
- Use descriptive branch names with prefixes:
  - `feature/` for new features
  - `fix/` for bug fixes
  - `docs/` for documentation updates
  - `chore/` for maintenance tasks

## Pull Requests
- All conversations must be resolved before merging
- Fill in the PR template with details about changes

## File Extensions
- GitHub Actions workflow files must use `.yml` extension (not `.yaml`)
- Template files should use `.tmpl` extension

## Naming Conventions
- Workflow job names should be lowercase (e.g., `ci`, `security`)
- Badge names in README should be lowercase
- File names should be lowercase with hyphens for spaces

## GitHub Actions

  - Results uploaded as SARIF format
  - Uses tfsec and Checkov for scanning
- CI workflow runs:

- Release job runs:

  - Generates changelog from commit messages

## Branch Protection

- Branch deletion is not allowed
- Branch is not locked

## Documentation
